# Chat_Assistant_For_SQLite-Database

###
A Python application that provides a natural language interface to query an SQLite database containing employee and department information. Built using Python's standard library (sqlite3 for database operations and tkinter for GUI).

### How the Assistant Works
### Core Components

### Natural Language Processing

* Parses user input using regex patterns
* Identifies query intent and parameters
* Maps to predefined SQL query templates


### Database Management

* SQLite database with two tables (Employees, Departments)
* Automatic initialization with sample data
* Thread-safe database operations

### Query Processing Flow

* Real-time query processing
* Error handling with user-friendly messages
* Input validation and SQL injection prevention
* Formatted response display

### Simulation of the code

* First we sholud create project directory
* After that we should set up Development Environment
* And then we should try to run Application
* Finally we should start testing the  queries


### Limitations

### Current Limitations

#### Query Processing

* The application is limited to predefined query patterns
* No fuzzy matching for similar queries
* Case-sensitive department names


#### Database

* Single database file
* No concurrent user support
* Limited to read-only operations


#### Interface

* Basic GUI design
* No data visualization
* Limited result formatting options
